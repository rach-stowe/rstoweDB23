RULE INFORMATION

Statement:  This rule clarifies the meaning of the return date of a carpet sale.

Constraint: A return date is only entered if a customer is renting a rug. If a customer
            purchases a rug outright, no return date is entered. If a customer buys a rug 
            after renting, the anticipated return date is removed. If a customer returns 
            a rug after renting, the return date remains.
